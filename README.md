This project applies Image & Video Processing (IVP) techniques to MRI brain scans to improve contrast and visibility before feeding them into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary classification:

Tumor

No Tumor

IVP preprocessing dramatically improves the image quality and helps the model learn features more effectively.

🎞️ IVP Techniques Applied
1️⃣ Grayscale Conversion

Simplifies computation and retains structural intensity.

2️⃣ Logarithmic Transform

Enhances dark regions.

3️⃣ Gamma Correction

Adjusts brightness (γ < 1 brightens, γ > 1 darkens).

4️⃣ Histogram Equalization

Improves global contrast.

5️⃣ CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)

Best performer for MRI images.
Avoids noise amplification and boosts local contrast.

6️⃣ Canny Edge Detection

Highlights edges and possible tumor boundaries.

CLAHE preprocessing gave the best improvements in prediction performance and visual clarity.

▶️ Demo Prediction

A function demo_predict(path) allows you to test the model on any individual MRI image:

demo_predict("brain_tumor_dataset/yes/Y1.jpg")


Displays the image and prints:
Tumor or No Tumor + probability.
